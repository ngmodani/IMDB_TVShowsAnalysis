But change is afoot at Downton \u2014 change far surpassing the new electric lights and telephone. A crisis of inheritance threatens to displace the resident Crawley family, in spite of the best efforts of the noble and compassionate Earl, Robert Crawley ; his American heiress wife, Cora his comically implacable, opinionated mother, Violet and his beautiful, eldest daughter, Mary, intent on charting her own course. Reluctantly, the family is forced to welcome its heir apparent, the self-made and proudly modern Matthew Crawley himself none too happy about the new arrangements. As Matthew's bristly relationship with Mary begins to crackle with electricity, hope for the future of Downton's dynasty takes shape. But when petty jealousies and ambitions grow among the family and the staff, scheming and secrets \u2014 both delicious and dangerous \u2014 threaten to derail the scramble to preserve <em>Downton Abbey</em>. Created and written by Oscar-winner Julian Fellowes, <em>Downton Abbey</em> offers a spot-on portrait of a vanishing way of life.</p>", "network": {"name": "ITV", "country": {"name": "United Kingdom", "code": "GB", "timezone": "Europe/London"}, "id": 35}, "runtime": 60, "language": "English", "premiered": "2010-09-26", "status": "Ended", "rating": {"average": 9.1}, "weight": 1, "webChannel": null, "genres": ["Drama", "Family", "Romance"]}
