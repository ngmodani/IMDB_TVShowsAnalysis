Robert Durst, the scion of a New York real estate empire, has long been a suspect in the notorious 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathie. Further suspicion was raised with the unsolved killing of his confidante, Susan Berman, thought to be a key witness in the investigation into Kathie's disappearance in 2000, as well as the subsequent killing and dismemberment of a neighbor in Galveston, Texas. Durst has consistently maintained his innocence and remains a free man today.</p>", "network": {"name": "HBO", "country": {"name": "United States", "code": "US", "timezone": "America/New_York"}, "id": 8}, "runtime": 60, "language": "English", "premiered": "2015-02-08", "status": "Ended", "rating": {"average": 8.3}, "weight": 0, "webChannel": null, "genres": ["Crime", "Mystery"]}
