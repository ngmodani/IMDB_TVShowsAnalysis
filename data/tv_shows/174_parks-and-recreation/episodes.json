The documentary cameras follow Leslie Knope a mid-level bureaucrat in the Parks and Recreation Department of Pawnee, Indiana. In an attempt to beautify her town Leslie takes on what should be a fairly simple project: help local nurse Ann Perkins turn an abandoned construction pit into a community park. Leslie is alternately helped and undermined by her colleague, Tom Haverford, who cheerfully exploits his government position for personal gain. She is also thwarted by her boss Ron Swanson who is philosophically opposed to government in any form. Helping Leslie and Ann navigate the Pawnee bureaucracy is charismatic city planner Mark Brendanawicz, whose outlook has been soured by 15 years of public service. If they can pull it off, Leslie hopes that she also will have inspired her uninterested college intern April and April's whole generation - all the while moving one step closer to her ultimate goal: becoming the first female president of the United States.</p>", "runtime": 30, "airdate": "2009-04-09", "airtime": "20:30"}, {"name": "Canvassing", "number": 2, "_links": {"self": {"href": "http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/12553"}}, "season": 1, "url": "http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/12553/parks-and-recreation-1x02-canvassing", "image": {"original": "http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/8/20334.jpg", "medium": "http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_landscape/8/20334.jpg"}, "id": 12553, "airstamp": "2009-04-16T20:30:00-04:00", "summary": "<p>Leslie and her committee go door-to-door to build support for her park project and recruit members for an upcoming town hall meeting, but their mission doesn't go as smoothly as Leslie hopes.
