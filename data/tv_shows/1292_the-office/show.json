He isn't. That doesn't stop him from embarrassing himself in front of the cameras on a regular basis, whether from his political sermonizing, his stand-up 'comedy', or his incredibly unique dancing. Meanwhile, long-suffering Tim longs after Dawn the engaged receptionist and keeps himself sane by playing childish practical jokes on his insufferable, army-obsessed deskmate Gareth. Will the Slough office be closed? Will the BBC give David a game show? Will Tim and Dawn end up with each other? And more importantly, will Gareth realize what a hopeless prat he is?</p>", "network": {"name": "BBC Two", "country": {"name": "United Kingdom", "code": "GB", "timezone": "Europe/London"}, "id": 37}, "runtime": 30, "language": "English", "premiered": "2001-07-09", "status": "Ended", "rating": {"average": 8.6}, "weight": 0, "webChannel": null, "genres": ["Comedy"]}
