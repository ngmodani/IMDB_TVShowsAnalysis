Drugs, Animal Rights, Crime, Paedophilia, these are the issues that the tabloids seem to spend their careers cashing in on. Brass Eye focused on the press and society's irrational focus on them. It takes full advantage of c-list celebrities desperate to look like they care about these 'important' issues but who only end up exposing their own ignorance and willingness to say anything if it gets them on TV.</p>", "network": {"name": "Channel 4", "country": {"name": "United Kingdom", "code": "GB", "timezone": "Europe/London"}, "id": 45}, "runtime": 30, "language": "English", "premiered": "1997-01-29", "status": "Ended", "rating": {"average": 10}, "weight": 0, "webChannel": null, "genres": ["Comedy"]}
