They chase criminals with perseverance \nand solve murders and other crimes that occur in Ankara.\n \nBehzat \u00c7. graduated from the Police academy in 1985. He does not care \nmuch about his superiors -not even laws in some cases; he only follows \nhis inner conscience. This often brings him troubles: Even though he \ngraduated from the Police Academy many years ago, he is still stuck in \nthe same position for years unlike his colleagues who are at the peak of\n their career, because of numerous suspensions and reprimands he got.\n \nAfter an unsuccessful marriage, he is not confident with women. The only\n woman he seems to care about is his daughter Berna.</p>", "network": {"name": "Star TV", "country": {"name": "Turkey", "code": "TR", "timezone": "Europe/Istanbul"}, "id": 409}, "runtime": 90, "language": "Turkish", "premiered": "2010-09-19", "status": "Ended", "rating": {"average": 10}, "weight": 0, "webChannel": null, "genres": ["Drama", "Action", "Crime"]}
