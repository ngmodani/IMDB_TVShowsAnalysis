Beaten into slavery. Reborn as a warrior. <strong>Spartacus</strong> is a graphic and visceral account of Rome's most famous gladiator. When he is separated from the love of his life, Spartacus is forced into the gruesome and bloodthirsty arena, where a grisly death is primetime entertainment. Spartacus must fight for survival, befriend his enemies and play politics in this new world of corruption, violence, sex and fame. He will be seduced by power and tormented by vengeance. But his passion will give him the strength to prevail over every obstacle, in this modern and uninhibited tale of death, honour and endurance.</p>", "network": {"name": "starz", "country": {"name": "United States", "code": "US", "timezone": "America/New_York"}, "id": 17}, "runtime": 60, "language": "English", "premiered": "2010-01-22", "status": "Ended", "rating": {"average": 8.7}, "weight": 1, "webChannel": null, "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"]}
