(\"One of the three best horror books about crabs I've ever read\" - Hard Gore Magazine). Back in the 1980s, he branched out into television production, writing and starring in a series so radical, so scary and so downright crazy that when the bosses of Channel 4 saw what they had on their hands, they ran away screaming, like little girls. Only now, twenty years on and amid the worst programming drought in television history, have the station finally allowed the show on the air. Intercut with new interviews with Marenghi himself and his co-stars Dean Learner and Todd Rivers, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is perhaps the most disturbing vision of hospital life ever broadcast.</p>", "network": {"name": "Channel 4", "country": {"name": "United Kingdom", "code": "GB", "timezone": "Europe/London"}, "id": 45}, "runtime": 25, "language": "English", "premiered": "2004-01-29", "status": "Ended", "rating": {"average": 9.3}, "weight": 0, "webChannel": null, "genres": ["Comedy", "Horror", "Science-Fiction"]}
