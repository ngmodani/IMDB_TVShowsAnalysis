Consigned to\n rubble, a rag-tag crew of South Bronx teenagers are nothings and \nnobodies with no one to shelter them - except each\n other, armed only with verbal games, improvised dance steps, some magic\n markers and spray cans. From Bronx tenements, to the SoHo art scene; \nfrom CBGBs to Studio 54 and even the glass towers of the just-built \nWorld Trade Center, The Get Down is a mythic saga\n of how New York at the brink of bankruptcy gave birth to hip-hop, punk \nand disco - told through the lives and music of the South Bronx kids \nwho changed the city, and the world... forever.</p>", "network": null, "runtime": 60, "language": "English", "premiered": "2016-08-12", "status": "Running", "rating": {"average": 7.8}, "weight": 1, "webChannel": {"name": "Netflix", "country": {"name": "United States", "code": "US", "timezone": "America/New_York"}, "id": 1}, "genres": ["Drama", "Music"]}
