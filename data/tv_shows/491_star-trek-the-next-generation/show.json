Enterprise (NCC-1701-D). This incarnation of the famous starship is much larger than the one captained by James T. Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women\u2026and, surprisingly, children. This era's Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard's crew enjoys many of the comforts they'd have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, \"replicated\" food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission\u2014no longer limited to a mere five years\u2014remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk's time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.</p>", "network": {"name": "Syndication", "country": {"name": "United States", "code": "US", "timezone": "America/New_York"}, "id": 72}, "runtime": 60, "language": "English", "premiered": "1987-09-28", "status": "Ended", "rating": {"average": 8.8}, "weight": 1, "webChannel": null, "genres": ["Adventure", "Science-Fiction"]}
